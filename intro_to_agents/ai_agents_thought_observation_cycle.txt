AI agent workflow, a cycle we defined as Thought-Action-Observation.

Core componenets:

Agents work in a continuous cycle of thinking(Thought) -> acting(Act) and observing(Observe).

Thought: The LLM part of the agent decides what the next step should be.
Action: The agent takes an action, by calling the tools with the associated arguments.
Observation: The model reflects on the response from the tool. 

The Thought-Action-Observation cycle 
the three components work together in a continuous loop. to use an analogy from programming, the agent uses a while loop: the loop continues until the objective of the agent has been fulfilled.       

in many agent frameworks, the rules and guidelines are embedded directly into the system prompt. ensures that every cycle adheres to a defined logic. 

Alfred's process is cyclical. it starts with a thought, then acts by calling a tool, and finally observes the outcome. If the observation had indicated an error or incomplete data, Alfred could have re-entered the cycle to correct its approach.
