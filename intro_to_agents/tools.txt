A tool is a function given to the LLM. This should fulfill a clear objective.

if you ask an LLM directly without a search tool for today's weather the LLM will potentially hallucinate random weather. but the AI agent has the websearch tool.

A tool should contain: a textual description of what the function does. a callable(something to perform an action) arguments with typings. 

LLMs as we saw, can only receive text inputs and generate text outputs. THey have no way to call tools on their own. What we mean when we talk about providing tools to an Agent, is that we can teach the LLM about the existence of tools and ask the model to generate text that will invoke tools when it needs to . 

Model Context protocol is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide tools to LLMs. MCP provides:
- a growing list of pre built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into.
- the flexibility to swtich between LLM providers and vendors.
- best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure.
