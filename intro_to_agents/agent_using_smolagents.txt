library that provides a framework for develpoing your agents with ease.

smolagents is a lightweight library is designed for simplicity but its abstracts away much of the complexity of building an agent, allowing you to focus on agent's behavior.

we will directly use the CodeAgent class from smolagents.

agent still uses the inferenceClient behind the HfApiModel class!

Adding tools will give your agent new capabilities.
